# InitMacro

### Original Repo 

This is a fork of https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/InitMacro for custom inits.

### Description

Read my article on Macros in [TradeRepublic](https://github.com/traderepublic)'s engineering blog: [Get Ready for Swift Macros](https://engineering.traderepublic.com/get-ready-for-swift-macros-fe21d3867e02)

This repo showcases a Swift Macro implementation that generates initializers for classes and structs. It's intended as a playground to explore this fantastic new feature in Swift.

I'm not an expert, so this implementation might not cover all possible cases. If you come across an unsupported case, please create an issue to let us know.

Contributions are highly encouraged and warmly welcomed. Feel free to contribute!

## Parameters

### `customDefaultName: String?`

Should an additional init be generated with `customDefaults` as the default argument. 

### `wildcards: [String]`

Set this if there are properties that will have an underscore before their name. 

### `public: Bool`

In case the initializer needs to be internal, set this to `false`.

Originally, this macro was built with public initializers in mind, since internal generators can be implicit in certain cases. 

## Signature

```swift
@Init(
  customDefaultName: String?, // default nil
	wildcards: [String], // default []
	public: Bool // default true
)
```

## Usage

https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/InitMacro/assets/1775157/db17cc39-a8cf-4340-9876-04d0c09e8ebe

## Testing

Open the example app and use your creativity.

## Known Issues

1. It doesn't support adding a default closure
2. The compiler can complain about `Undefined symbol: ___llvm_profile_runtime`. This is a bug in the current betas:
	- It can be bypassed for now by adding `linkerSettings: [.unsafeFlags(["-fprofile-instr-generate"])]` to your macro target.

## Installation

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Your Target Name",
  dependencies: [
  	// ...
    .package(url: "https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/InitMacro.git", branch: "main")
  	// ...
  ]
)
```
